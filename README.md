Sensitivity: LNT Construction Internal Use
Problem Description
➢ Oil spills represent a major threat to ocean ecosystems and their health
➢ The recent incident in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrates the potentially catastrophic nature
of offshore oil spills
➢ Prevention of Illicit pollution requires continuous monitoring and satellite remote sensing
technology represents an attractive option for operational oil spill detection
➢ Oil spill binary classification is a type of machine learning problem aimed at identifying oil
spills in satellite or aerial imagery
➢ Oil spill detection is a crucial part of minimizing the impact of spills and ensuring the safety
and protection of the environment and communities of underwater affected by spills
